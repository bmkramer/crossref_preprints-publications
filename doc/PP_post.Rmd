## Linking preprints and published articles

Preprints allow rapid dissemination of research results, early feedback, and potential diversification of how peer review is organized. As such, preprints can be considered part of the 'record of versions' of a publication, that can also include a peer-reviewed version in a journal or other publication venue.  

To be able to access this full 'record of versions', it is important to be able to link preprints to subsequent versions of the work. Such links can be displayed together with the preprint (Fig 1), which is useful for people who acccess the preprint that way. When these links are also included in the metadata of the preprint (and the published paper), they can be accessed programmatically and (re)used in various ways, e.g. for analysis, to combine citations to the preprint and published version, and to link both versions in discovery systems.

For preprint servers that use [Crossref](https://crossref.org) DOIs, Crossref notifies the preprint server of potential matches with published articles. It requires preprint servers to verify the links and add them to the metadata record of the preprint. 
(see https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/213126346-Posted-content-includes-preprints#assoc). Crossref also recommends, but does not require, publishers to add links to preprints in the metadata of their publications.
